Architecture
In our full-stack project, we utilized multiple frontend development approaches, including Express HTML rendering and a single-page application (SPA) with Angular. Express HTML served as a traditional server-side rendering approach, where HTML pages were generated dynamically on the server and sent to the client. In contrast, the SPA approach with Angular involved rendering views and managing client-side routing entirely on the browser, resulting in a more dynamic and interactive user experience. While Express HTML is suitable for simpler applications with less client-side interactivity, SPAs offer richer functionality and improved performance for more complex applications.

The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database primarily for its flexibility and scalability. NoSQL databases like MongoDB are well-suited for applications with rapidly changing data structures and large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Additionally, MongoDB's document-oriented nature allows for easy horizontal scaling and schema flexibility, making it a suitable choice for our full-stack application where data requirements may evolve over time.

Functionality
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is derived from JavaScript object literals. It serves as a common data format for communication between the frontend and backend components of a full-stack application. JSON is easy to read and write for both humans and machines, making it ideal for transmitting structured data over a network. In our project, JSON tied together the frontend and backend development pieces by serving as the standard data format for API requests and responses, facilitating seamless communication between the client and server components.

Throughout the full-stack development process, we refactored code to improve functionality and efficiency, particularly in the context of reusable user interface (UI) components. By abstracting common UI elements into reusable components, such as navigation bars or form inputs, we reduced duplication of code and improved maintainability. This approach allowed us to quickly iterate on the UI, enhance consistency across the application, and streamline development efforts. The benefits of reusable UI components include improved code organization, enhanced developer productivity, and easier maintenance and updates.

Testing
In a full-stack application, various methods for request and retrieval necessitate different types of API testing of endpoints. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end (E2E) testing to ensure the reliability and functionality of the application. Unit testing focuses on testing individual components or functions in isolation, while integration testing verifies interactions between different parts of the system. E2E testing simulates real user interactions with the application to validate its behavior from end to end. Additionally, testing with added layers of security, such as authentication and authorization, presents additional challenges, requiring specialized testing strategies to ensure the security and integrity of the application.
